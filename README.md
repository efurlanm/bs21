# Comparison of HPC approaches in the Python environment for a 5-point stencil test problem

This work is a small primer for the use of HPC resources in the Python programming environment, including Jupyter Notebook, in particular the use on a supercomputer. The test problem is a known problem of heat transfer over a finite surface, modeled by the partial differential equation of Poisson. It models the normalized temperature distribution on a surface over a series of iterations that make up the simulation. As commonly used for numerical solutions, this equation is discretized in a finite grid and solved using a finite difference method. The specific algorithm requires the calculation of a 5-point stencil in the 2D domain grid to update temperatures every step of the time.

This repository contains only the implementation codes, which are in the Jupyter Notebook (JN) files. The JN were also used for experimentation, and improvements, organization, documentation, and translation from Portuguese to English, is a work in permanent construction.

Milligan [[1]](#1) describes how the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota adopted support for interactive HPC computing and user-friendly reproducible computing using Jupyter Notebook (JN), in a supercomputing environment that includes scheduling and job control. JN is not restricted to the Python language, it can be used for other languages. Feedback surveys showed that students prefer the JN platform more than the traditional command line on the console.

The work shows motivation, implementation, and lessons learned.
