Paper: Comparison of HPC approaches in the Python environment for a 5-point stencil test problem.

This work is a small primer for the use of HPC resources in the Python environment, including Jupyter Notebook (JN), in particular the use on a supercomputer. The test problem is a known problem of heat transfer over a finite surface, modeled by the partial differential equation of Poisson. It models the normalized temperature distribution on a surface over a series of iterations that make up the simulation. As commonly used for numerical solutions, this equation is discretized in a finite grid and solved using a finite difference method. The specific algorithm requires the calculation of a 5-point stencil in the 2D domain grid to update temperatures every step of the time.

This repository contains the implementation code that were executed on the SDumont supercomputer using JN. The .ipynb files used are available in this repository. The JN were also used for experimentation, improvements, organization, and  documentation. The article can be found in the [Proceedings of the Brazilian e-Science Workshop (BreSci) 2021](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/bresci/issue/view/759), [DOI](http://doi.org/10.5753/bresci.2021.15786).

Milligan [[1]](#1) describes how the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota adopted support for interactive HPC computing and user-friendly reproducible computing using Jupyter Notebook (JN), in a supercomputing environment that includes scheduling and job control. JN is not restricted to the Python language, it can be used for other languages. Feedback surveys showed that students prefer the JN platform more than the traditional command line on the console.

Thomas et al. [[2]](#2) describes the use of JN, a popular and flexible web application for literate computing, for interactive and data intensive supercomputing in a Cray XC40 Cori system, at the National Center for Scientific Computing in Energy Research (NERSC). The work shows motivation, implementation, and lessons learned.

Mansour et al. [[3]](#3) describes the rewriting of an HPC geodynamic modeling application to use the resources available in the Python environment, including JN. The application is used in the Python UWGeodynamics module that allows a structured interface for the construction of geodynamic models, which is used in several recent publications.

Nishimura et al. [[4]](#4) describes the rewriting of the Tracy library used for lattice optimization, using the Python environment including JN, for ease of use and flexibility, running on HPC clusters at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The balance between performance and productivity was achieved through the joint use of C++ and Python. The need to become user-friendly is due to the fact that many scientists are not comfortable dealing with complex software development tools.
