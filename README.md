# Comparison of High-performance Computing Approaches in the Python Environment for a Five-point Stencil Test Problem

The test problem is a known problem of heat transfer over a finite surface, modeled by the partial differential equation of Poisson. It models the normalized temperature distribution on a surface over a series of iterations that make up the simulation. As commonly used for numerical solutions, this equation is discretized in a finite grid and solved using a finite difference method. The specific algorithm requires the calculation of a 5-point stencil in the 2D domain grid to update temperatures every step of the time.

The different implementations are in the Jupyter Notebook files in this repository. Notebooks were also used for experimentation, and a better organization, as well as better documentation, is a work in permanent construction. Some parts of Notebooks use the Portuguese language. To analyze the results, create tables, generate graphs, and show the results, you can use the Python environment, but in this work, due to the ease of use of the LaTex documentation, this feature was not used.
